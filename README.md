### **_*Description*_**

#### This app will help you see if your nearest McDonald restaurant has a working ice cream machine or not.

<br/>

#### The MVP for this project will function from crowsourced data. When a user has a craving for ice cream that only McDonald's can sastify they will be able to see if a local restaurant has a working ice cream machine or a broken machine. They will be able to access the database in a list form and filter by neighborhoods in Charlotte, NC. If a user is at a restaurant and the listing is inaccurate, the user will be able to update or delete the listing.
