### **_*Description*_**

#### This app will help you see if your nearest McDonald restaurant has a working ice cream machine or not.

<br/>

#### The MVP for this project will function from crowsourced data. When a user has a craving for ice cream that only McDonald's can sastify they will be able to see if a local restaurant has a working ice cream machine or a broken machine. They will be able to access the database in a list form and filter by neighborhoods in Charlotte, NC. If a user is at a restaurant and the listing is inaccurate, the user will be able to update or delete the listing.

- [] Not be written using any other languages or frameworks not covered in this course so far (TypeScript, Sass, jQuery, UI Frameworks, etc.)
- [] Have a separate directory for the frontend (client) and have your backend within the main repository.
- [] Include a beautiful, professional README.md (use markdown)
- [] Your README should have your name, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
- [] Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)
- [] Include a minimum of 2 Mongoose Schemas (models)
